# password-checker
Simple example of how to detect weak or strong password .

Basicly in this example we can simulate a password-checker . 

The user is entering some usernames and passwords as long as they are not empty . When that happens previous names and passwords are 
added to the list. 

Program is checking that list for every element individualy whitch detect whether the password is same as username , in or the password is a 
sequence of a number  and if password is too short . In that case program is sorting those names and pw's in the list for not-acceptable passwords,
which we can loop trough and output them to the screen (output in console) .
